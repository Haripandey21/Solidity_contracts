# Whitelist 
This is a smart contract called "Whitelist" that manages a whitelist of addresses on the Ethereum blockchain. The contract has a maximum number of whitelisted addresses that can be added and keeps track of the number of addresses already whitelisted.
The contract allows addresses to join the whitelist by calling the "joinWhiteList" function, but only if they have not already been whitelisted and the maximum number of whitelisted addresses has not been reached. If these conditions are met, the address is added to the whitelist and the number of whitelisted addresses is incremented. 

- that whitelisted addresses can be used for any Airdrops,ICO,pre-sale of nfts,etc etc..
